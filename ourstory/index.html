              To set the scene, it was a chilly night in November of 2013. Greg and Jesiah had no idea each other existed but yet found themselves on the same floor and in the same corner at Saratoga City Tavern - a popular bar on Caroline St. Unsual for Greg, he was out on the town for the night, coaxed by his best friend Tom to hit up the bars.

              Tom and Greg settled on the second floor of Tavern to catch up and enjoy some beer. It was a weird spot - beside the staircase. Tom excused himself for a few leaving Greg alone. A few seconds later Jesiah emerged from the stairs and settled in on the barstool next to Greg - seemed like perfect spot to catch any friends that passed by. "You're in my friends seat" Greg said. Those were the first words they spoke to eachother. Somehow that turned into exchanging life stories and the infamous "I really like your eyebrows!" compliment Jesiah gave to Greg.

            <p class="detail1" style="padding-top:10px;">
               Since then the couple has been inseperable. Residents of Saratoga Springs for more than 5 years they are proud Upstate New Yorkers and enjoy exploring the villages, parks and greater outdoors that surrounds them. Avid hikers - Greg and Jesiah love to head north to the Adirondacks or the local nature trails. Although Greg would probably prefer to stay home and play his Xbox, Jesiah has managed to drag him to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, Treasure Island in Florida, Mont Tremblant in Canada and the Almafi Coast of Italy. She even managed to expand Greg's palate - he now eats vegetables and foods other than pizza.
