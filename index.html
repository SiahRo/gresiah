                <p>
                It was Fall of 2013. Greg had recently moved to Saratoga Springs to begin his new job at Glens Falls Hospital. His best friend Tom was up for the weekend and had convinced Greg to go downtown for a few drinks. Tom had left briefly to use the restroom when Jesiah swooped in and stole his barstool. Greg saw an opportunity - and bravely sparked conversation. "You're in my friend's seat" he said. Those were the first words that started it all. Jesiah, intrigued by the audacious young man with great eyebrows, decided to stick around. This pivotal seat snatching moment led to conversations about work and life. The two hit it off quickly and before long they had exchanged phone numbers.
                </p>

                <p>
                Fast forward to 2018, Greg and Jesiah had went from weird bar exchanges to life partners in crime. They've lived with each other for a whole 4 years co-parenting their adult cat Alejandro. In between normal adulthood they've enjoyed countless trips to almost everywhere in eastern New York and have hiked almost all the easy Adirondack mountains. They've vacationed together to the Dominican Republic, Aruba, Canada and Florida. Somehow, in 2018 Jesiah managed to convince Greg to take his first long-haul flight to Italy. In a small town along the Sorrento Coast with Mt. Vesuvius in view, Greg revealed a shiny rock he had been concealing the entire trip and asked Jesiah, "Will you marry me?" Jesiah laughed, then cried and said yes!

              <p>The role Jevon has been anticipating for 30 years has finally come - Maid of Honor. Jevon cannot wait to tend to her little sister's beck and call. It's been a long wait but she's well prepared for the job. As an Art Director in NYC, Jevon is used to successfully rallying the troops. She also has invaluable experience being an elder sister for almost her entire life. At 6 years old - Jevon's life was change forever when her coveted position as "Only Child" ended ubruptly and little Jesiah entered the world. Enter Jevin shortly after and you have what is known as "Those Roche Kids". Throughout it all Jevon has been the leader of the pack, deftly showing us the way and dealing with her little siblings' antics.   </p>

              <p>Melissa is literally the sweetest little sister a person can have. Easy going, thoughtful and fun - Melissa is always there when you need her. Greg and Melissa, despite being two "Only Childs", share an incredible relationship. One might look onto their relationship and wonder, "How could it be that two siblings get along so great?". However, behind the facade lies the normal antics of siblinghood. Greg loves to tell the story of "The Seatbelt" and don't get Melissa started about "Batting Practice". Not to mention Melissa is a talented gymnast (and also the strongest sibling). As an elementary school teacher, Melissa surely has the skills needed to deal with this "adult" Bridal Party.   </p>

You can count on her to be the reliable rock of the family (not to mention she makes an incredible buffalo chicken dip). Even with a Roche kid of her own - she has graciously agreed to tend to the elder middle Roche on the most important day of her life. Sweet, caring and attentive, Case face will be an invaluable bridesmaid when she's not running around after the little Roche below.     </p>

They've gone through long hair, baggy UFO pants and all the other teenage phases together. Leader of the Old Bridge wolf pack, Anthony can be counted on to execute the incredibly important task of getting the groom to the alter in one piece (no promises on timing though). Anthony will most likely bring his business acumen and arsenal of spreadsheets to accomplish this task.   </p>

              <p>Dan has been one of Greg's best friends since middle school. Always reliable, Dan didn't hesitate to SUIT UP! to be Greg's groomsmen.  Greg will always look fondly back on their weekly Chick-Fil-A dates in Philly, although cut tragically short when Dan finished his engineering degree. The two geeks of the bunch, Dan is always willing to widthstand Greg's nerdy and exhaustive tangents slightly longer than the rest of the bunch before recommending he, "have another drink." </p>

Quiet, yet the life of the party, Tom is always down for a good time. When Greg was living in Saratoga by himself Tom reached out and made the journey up to keep him company. A good friend down for good times, Tom might be the reason Greg is late to the alter.  </p>

              <p>The last of Roche clan, Jevin is Jesiah and Jevon's little brother but don't let that fool you. Quiet he is not.  You might see him at the wedding getting the party started and keeping the festivities moving. In the early days people would mistake Jevin and Jesiah as twins. Later on Jesiah's  other name in high school was 'Jevin's Sister'. As popular as he may be, you can count on Jevin to be there, hence why he was quick to accept the position of groomsmen. When he's not chasing the flower girl you might find him in the middle of the dance floor.    </p>
